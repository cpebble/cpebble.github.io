> A mystery wrapped in an enigma, with a side of fries

This is my first entry into the world of blogging and self-marketing. For a while i've wanted to
experiment with getting some of my ideas out there, and this is my way of doing so.

If you're reading this, this content is very much unfinished, and should not be regarded as 
anything more than text on a screen

## Who am i
I'm a primarily self-taught developer with a passion for computer science. I'm currently getting
my bachelors and masters degree at DIKU, the computer science faculty at Copenhagen University.  
The university also employs me, as a developer on an internal employee management app, which i of
course am not at liberty to discuss publicly. Do however note that if i ever mention an old python
codebase with wonky design choices and a crap-ton of weird bugs and dependencies, this is what i'll
be referring to. Either that or i just started yet another side project.

In short form, my timeline looks like this 

**1998-2014**
: I was a kid. I played around in mud, and played Battleon and Runescape.
: I got a dev kit for Visual Basic 98
: I learned HTML/CSS off youtube

**2014-2017**
: High school. A universally great time that everyone enjoys
: I got serious about programming in this time, and started self-learning alongside(or instead of)
school courses
: I installed Arch Linux as my main OS, a decision that would come back to haunt me, yet ultimately
has shaped me and my goals permanently
: I put Python on my resume. Woohoo snake rules
: I got a job doing web development for start-ups

**2017-2018**
: Full time web developer
: I did wordpress sites initially
: I transitioned into using a more modern stack of Django-Vue-Postgres
: I got introduced to the concept of "Surplus labor value" by example
: My python skills greatly improved

**2018-present**
: I was lucky enough to start my bachelors degree in computer science
: I shifted my focus from web stuff into systems stuff
: I worked as a security analyst
: I got good at writing the C programming language

And that's about it for me. I'll probably do a more in-depth post once i get into this whole 
blogging thing.
